<h1>Genetic Optimization Algorithm</h1>
A Genetic algorithm that uses the concept of Chromosome Crossover to generate new, higher-fitness solutions. Solutions are generated until a generation that contains an individual 
which matches the target.

<br></br>
**Limitations:** Solutions may not converge to the target when approaching local minima. This will require editing the mutation and/or survival rate.
